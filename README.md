To set up MongoDB on Windows, you can follow these steps:
Go to the MongoDB download page, Select the Free Edition and Community Server then Click Download
Connect to MongoDB:Open MongoDB Compass.
In the connection string, enter mongodb://localhost:27017/ to connect to your local MongoDB instance.
Click on Connect. Before building the interface, ensure that you have connected to MongoDB and loaded your CSV data, as described earlier.
In this project our aim to develop an automated data query and retrieval system using Large
Language models. It involves building a Python-based interface where the user
can input the name of a CSV column header. Based on the user's input, you will use an LLM to generate a MongoDB
query that can retrieve relevant data from the database.
